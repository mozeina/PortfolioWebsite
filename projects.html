                            this was a standard view for an imaginary Art Shop that I came up with, which offers Paint, Brushes and Canvases</p>

                        <p>This was a cheatsheet I made that helped me memorize Colors in CSS and how to apply them, including standard conventially named colors, RGB colors, 
                            Hexadecimal colors, and HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness), this table was used to understand the properties and their meanings.</p>

                        <p>This page was just a selection of different CSS styles I was going to use for a website, organizing what I wanted to use in a page like this really helped me 
                            understand what I was trying to do and how to do it, this included the Fonts, Colors, and more styles that I determined for the use of my new website.
